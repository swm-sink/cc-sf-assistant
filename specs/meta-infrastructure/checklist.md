# Meta-Infrastructure Validation Checklist

**Version:** 1.1-DRAFT (RESEQUENCED)
**Date:** 2025-11-09 (Updated for Dev-First Priority)
**Purpose:** Track progress and validate alignment across RPIV phases for meta-infrastructure development

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: RESEQUENCED IMPLEMENTATION ORDER

**🚨 IMPLEMENTATION ORDER CHANGE (2025-11-09):**

Phases below are numbered sequentially (Phase 1, 2, 3...) for organizational clarity, but **implementation order is different**:

```
ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION SEQUENCE:

1️⃣ FIRST: Phase 7 (Development Workflows) - Week 1-2
2️⃣ SECOND: Phase 1 (Shared Foundation) - Week 3
3️⃣ THIRD: Phases 2-6 (Production Infrastructure) - Week 4-11
4️⃣ FOURTH: Phase 8 (Orchestration) - Week 12
```

**When marking components complete, implement in the order above, NOT numerical order.**

**See:** plan.md for full rationale. TL;DR: Build the tools to build tools first.

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1: Complexity Overload**
- **Impact:** 34 components to create may be overwhelming
- **Mitigation:** Phased rollout, start with shared foundation
- **Status:** ✅ Mitigated via plan.md phasing

**Risk 2: External API Changes**
- **Impact:** Databricks/Adaptive/Google APIs may change
- **Mitigation:** Version-pin dependencies, abstract API clients
- **Status:** 🔄 Mitigated via integration layer design

**Risk 3: Credential Management**
- **Impact:** Users may struggle with OAuth/Service Account setup
- **Mitigation:** `/setup` command guides through credential setup
- **Status:** ✅ Mitigated via setup command

**Risk 4: Testing Coverage**
- **Impact:** Edge cases may be missed
- **Mitigation:** Use financial-validator edge cases as checklist
- **Status:** ✅ Mitigated via comprehensive edge case list

## Open Questions

### 1. Command Nesting
**Question:** Can `/prod:monthly-close` invoke `/extract-databricks` directly?
**Status:** ⏳ To be tested during Phase 8 implementation
**Decision:** Defer until Phase 8

### 2. Google Authentication
**Question:** OAuth or Service Account JSON?
**Status:** 🔄 Support both options
**Decision:** Implement both, let user choose

### 3. Pre-Commit Hooks
**Question:** Automatic installation or prompt user?
**Status:** 🔄 Prompt user during `/setup`
**Decision:** Ask permission, explain benefits
