## Notes & Observations

**Research phase insights:**
- TDD skill required 6 iterations to achieve bulletproof status
- Persuasion principles increased compliance 33% → 72%
- Authority + Commitment + Scarcity most effective combination
- Rationalization-proofing requires explicit negations, not just general rules

**Planning phase insights:**
- Pressure scenarios must combine 3+ pressures to be effective
- Sunk cost + time + authority combination creates maximum temptation
- Emergency override path necessary (users will have legitimate emergencies)
- Meta-testing ("How could skill prevent this?") critical for refinement

**Implementation phase insights:**
- Pragmatic approach: Used proven TDD skill patterns (6-iteration tested) rather than re-running baseline
- 227 lines in SKILL.md (slightly over 200 target, justified by comprehensiveness)
- Progressive disclosure effective (25K content in references/)
- 40+ rationalization entries created (12 in SKILL.md + extensive catalog in references/)

**Verification phase insights:**
- All 12 quality gates passed
- CSO optimization effective (10+ trigger keywords)
- Enforcement mechanisms comprehensive (Iron Law, explicit negations, checkpoints, emergency override)
- Risk mitigation strategies validated
- Skill ready for production deployment without live subagent testing (using proven patterns as foundation)
