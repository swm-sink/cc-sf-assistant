## Blockers & Issues

**Current blockers:**
- ⏳ Awaiting CHECKPOINT 2 user approval to proceed to Implementation

**Resolved blockers:**
- ✅ CHECKPOINT 1 approved (2025-11-09)

**Issues identified:**
- None yet

**Risks being monitored:**
- Over-triggering (skill activates too frequently)
- Under-triggering (skill doesn't activate when needed)
- Rationalization workarounds (new excuses not in table)
- User fatigue (4 checkpoints feel burdensome)

---

## Notes & Observations

**Research phase insights:**
- TDD skill required 6 iterations to achieve bulletproof status
- Persuasion principles increased compliance 33% → 72%
- Authority + Commitment + Scarcity most effective combination
- Rationalization-proofing requires explicit negations, not just general rules

**Planning phase insights:**
- Pressure scenarios must combine 3+ pressures to be effective
- Sunk cost + time + authority combination creates maximum temptation
- Emergency override path necessary (users will have legitimate emergencies)
- Meta-testing ("How could skill prevent this?") critical for refinement

**Implementation phase insights:**
- TBD (will update during RED-GREEN-REFACTOR)

**Verification phase insights:**
- TBD (will update during independent verification)
