## Honorable Mentions

[`prpm`](https://prpm.dev/) &nbsp; by &nbsp; [khaliqgant](https://github.com/khaliqgant)    
`prpm` is something like a plugin marketplace, but with additional support for other providers and coding agents. Although (for the moment 🤞) we are unable to include plugins/marketplaces on the list, I wanted to give special recognition to khaliqgant - after I notified him that I was unable to find any license information for third-party resources that he was hosting on his website, he immediately took action and added a great enhancement to the website's UI, which provides a direct link to the original authors' LICENSE file, as well the ability to view it as a simple dropdown. In my opinion, this is a pretty awesome thing to do to show support for the open source community, and for the developers whose work is featured on this list. I see marketplaces springing up all over the internet now where basic attribution rights are not being respected (maybe for the simple reason that software licenses are complicated!), so I commend khaliqgant for setting a great example with [`prpm`](https://prpm.dev/), and I encourage others to promote and enforce these rights in the service of open source software.
