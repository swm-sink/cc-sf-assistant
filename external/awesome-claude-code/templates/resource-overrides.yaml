# Resource Overrides Configuration
# This file allows manual overrides of specific resource fields
# Use resource IDs to target specific resources
#
# IMPORTANT: Any field you set here is AUTOMATICALLY LOCKED from validation updates
# You do NOT need to manually specify *_locked flags
#
# Example override structure:
# overrides:
#   cmd-a3f2b9c4:  # Resource ID
#     license: "LicenseRef-MIT-Commons-Clause"  # Automatically locked
#   cmd-xyz123:
#     skip_validation: true  # Skip this resource entirely during validation

overrides:
  # Claude Task Manager - has Commons Clause restriction
  wf-d0cfdd2b:
    license: "LicenseRef-MIT-Commons-Clause"

  # Claude Code Chat - temporarily unavailable for validation
  tool-984936a7:
    skip_validation: true

  # Resources with manual license overrides
  status-4e8a47cf:
    license: "MIT"

  # Resource removed from origin
  claude-1279cf13:
    skip_validation: true
  
  # 404
  cmd-9944dc47:
    skip_validation: true

  output-2d98cb4f:
    license: "MIT"

  status-bb559460:
    license: "MIT"

  tool-1e4657fd:
    license: "MIT"

# Supported override fields:
# - license: Override the detected license (automatically locked)
# - active: Override the active status (automatically locked)
# - description: Override the description (automatically locked)
# - last_checked: Override last checked timestamp (automatically locked)
# - last_modified: Override last modified timestamp (automatically locked)
# - skip_validation: Skip entire resource during validation (highest precedence)
#
# Notes:
# - Use resource IDs (e.g., cmd-a3f2b9c4) not display names
# - Any field you set is automatically locked from validation updates
# - Resources with skip_validation: true are completely skipped by validation scripts
# - skip_validation has highest precedence - if set, no field validation occurs
# - Overrides take precedence over CSV data during generation
